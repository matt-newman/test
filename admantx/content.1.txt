MARCUS RASHFORD and Jesse Lingard have once again incurred the wrath of fans following cryptic posts uploaded on their Instagram story. The Manchester United duo appeared to reference they are among the 0.012 per cent of young players to make it to the Premier League. 1 Manchester United duo Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard both posted &quot;0.012%&quot; on Instagram A study from Business Insider revealed that only 180 of the 1.5million youth footballers in England reach the top-flight - with academy players more likely to get hit by a meteorite. And Rashford and Lingard look to have referenced that astonishing statistic, as they both simply posted &quot;0.012&#37;&quot; on their social media account. Lingard, 26, made his Premier League debut on the opening weekend of the 2014/15 Premier League season, while Rashford, 21, broke into the Red Devils&#x27; first-team squad the following campaign. Fans were quick to criticise the pair, as one tweeted: &quot;Lingard and Rashford both now showing their arrogance because they have made it as professional footballers, they are demanding respect. &quot;Carry on performing like you have, you’ll be playing in League 2 by the age of 30.&quot; Another quipped: &quot;Rashford and Lingard posting their goal per shot ratio on Instagram.&quot; While another joked: &quot;Probability of Rashford hitting the target from a free-kick.&quot; One said: &quot;This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about when I said Lingard is a bad influence on Rashford.&quot; Another simply stated: &quot;The amount of effort they put in this season.&quot; Romelu Lukaku will take pay-cut to leave Manchester United after ‘agreeing terms with Inter Milan’ LATEST MAN UTD NEWSLive BlogSOL SEARCHING Get the latest updates from Old Trafford as Ole plots summer overhaul GossipPAUL ME CLOSER Pogba transfer to Real &#x27;practically done&#x27; as Man Utd ace &#x27;agrees to pay cut&#x27; NOT TOO KEANE Roy Keane missed Man U reunion due to Rashford and Lingard outfits, joke fans GossipCASH OUT Lukaku &#x27;will take pay-cut to leave Man Utd after &#x27;agreeing terms with Inter&#x27; GossipBARCING MAD Prem clubs given boost as Barca look to offload Coutinho, Dembele and Malcom  While one United fan added: &quot;Our chances to win the league.&quot; The Red Devils duo were also mocked for their choice of outfits at Old Trafford on the weekend, while they were also ridiculed for their attempt at recreating Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#x27;s dramatic strike against Bayern Munich in 1999.
